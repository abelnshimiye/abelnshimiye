As a Software Engineer with over three years of experience, I have honed my skills in software development, information systems development, embedded and mobile systems design and management, and data science. With a passion for teaching, I have also enjoyed sharing my expertise with others.
Throughout my career, I have worked on diverse projects, from developing complex software applications to designing cutting-edge embedded systems. I am skilled in a variety of programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++, and I have experience using data analysis tools such as SQL, Tableau, and Excel.
In addition to my technical expertise, I am a proactive problem-solver committed to delivering high-quality results. I am a strong communicator and work well in a team environment, where I am always eager to collaborate and learn from my colleagues.
I'd love to connect if you're looking for a dedicated and experienced engineer who can help you achieve your goals.
